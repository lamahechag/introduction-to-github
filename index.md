title: Welcome to my blog about Probability and Statistics, Statistical Physics, and Complexity
---

The firts lecture of this blog will be about association and correlation. Where the main formula for correlation
is 

$$ H(x) = -\sum_{x_i} p(x_i)\log_2(p(x_i))$$,
and mutual information content
$$ I(X;Y) = H(X) - H(X\vert Y)$$,
which means the average reduction in uncertanity about $x$ if you know the value of $y$.
